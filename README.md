## What it does

ctx gives your LLM a persistent, searchable memory. Store knowledge blocks, query them with hybrid retrieval (semantic + bilingual fulltext + trigram), then rerank with multi-dimensional cyclic gravity — each temporal cycle (weekday, month, quarter, week, monthday, seasonal, daily) scored as its own Gaussian field. Queries like "immer dienstags" or "Weihnachten" activate specific dimensions.

Every block carries anchors from both its content (dates mentioned in text) AND its `created_at` timestamp, so a note about "Meeting am Dienstag" is findable by the day it discusses and the day it was written. **Dream Mode** runs as a continuous background loop — autonomously discovering relationships between blocks, marking outdated information, and promoting high-quality content. Your knowledge base grows, self-organizes, and stays current.

It speaks **MCP, a CLI, and a plain HTTP API**, ships an embedded web UI, and isolates multiple tenants down to the individual block.

## Quick install

```bash
# Binary (Linux/macOS/Windows)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/GottZ/ctx/releases/latest/download/ctx-$(uname -s | tr A-Z a-z)-$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/') -o /usr/local/bin/ctx && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ctx

# Or with Go
go install github.com/GottZ/ctx/cmd/ctx@latest
```

Point the CLI at your ctx host:

```bash
ctx init      # config, server check, backend pool, Claude Code hooks, statusline
```

`ctx init` asks for base URL and API key, writes `~/.config/ctx/config`, and checks the server. With a server-admin key it also seeds the **backend pool** — the chat and embedding backend ctx serves from — when no backend serves those roles yet, and probes the ones it finds; with any other key it skips that step and says so. Re-running it changes only what is missing.

<details>
<summary>Or configure it by hand</summary>

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/ctx
cat > ~/.config/ctx/config << 'EOF'
CTX_BASE_URL=https://your-ctx-host.example
CTX_KEY=your-api-key-here
EOF
ctx health                                  # DB + backend connectivity
ctx backends seed --host http://gpu:11434 \
  --model qwen3 --embed-model qwen3-embedding   # first backends, non-interactive
```
</details>

Running the server (Go daemon + PostgreSQL 18 + pgvector) is `docker compose up -d ctx`. Full setup, env vars and Claude Code integration are in [operations](docs/operations.md); building from source in [development](docs/development.md).

> **Upgrading from v4? Reach v4.38.0 first.** v5.0.0 removes the `CTX_{CHAT,CHAT_FALLBACK,EMBED,DREAM,DREAM_EMBED,RERANK}_*` connection variables: backends are configured in the pool (`ctx backends`) and nowhere else. **v4.38.0 is the last release that still reads those variables**, and one boot on it carries a `.env`-only configuration into the pool for you, then names every variable and leftover settings row you still have. Going straight from an older v4 to v5 is not fatal down to v4.19.0 — the env bridge is gone by then and you re-enter your topology by hand with `ctx backends seed` — but **below v4.19.0 it is a hard stop**: v5 folds migrations 001–113 into a single baseline and refuses a database that never applied 113. Migration path and rollback notes: [operations](docs/operations.md#migration-133-the-backend-tuple-rows-are-deleted--and-the-upgrade-hop-that-has-to-come-first).

**Models:** the tested reference stack is qwen3.6:27b for chat/synthesis/dream/digest, Qwen3-Embedding-8B (1024-dim, CPU-sized) for embeddings, and a bge-reranker-v2-m3 cross-encoder sidecar for rerank — but ctx is engine-agnostic: any OpenAI-compatible or Ollama API works, models are per-backend configuration. CPU-only setups work; a GPU shortens chat latency. Details: [Models & hardware](docs/operations.md#models--hardware).

## How LLMs use ctx

ctx is designed to be the persistent memory layer for LLM agents. Five primitives, composable:

| Use case | Tool | When |
|----------|------|------|
| **Retrieve** prior knowledge before answering | `ctx query "question"` | Whenever the answer might depend on past sessions, project state, or stored decisions |
| **Persist** a new finding | `ctx save <category> <title> - <content>` | After non-obvious discoveries, architecture decisions, resolved bugs, config changes |
| **Update** an existing block | `ctx save` with same `<category> <title>` | category+title is the upsert key — re-saving replaces |
| **Browse** without LLM cost | `ctx search [category] [query:text]` | Listing, sanity-checking, lightweight lookups |
| **Inspect** a specific block | `ctx get <block-id>` | Following an id from query sources or another block |

**Categories** (semantic, not enforced): `infrastructure`, `decisions`, `projects`, `reference`, `learnings`, `agent-briefing`, `index`. Pick by intent: one fact per block, precise title, tags for cross-cutting. ~1–1.5k chars max — split, don't grow.

**Access paths** (in order of preference for LLM agents):

1. **MCP** — `claude.ai ctx` server (Streamable HTTP transport). Tools: `query`, `store`, `search`, `get`, `recent`. JSON-schemas, no shell-quoting. Use this in Claude Code / claude.ai sessions.
2. **CLI** — `/usr/local/bin/ctx` — shell pipelines, cron, scripts. Config in `~/.config/ctx/config`.
3. **HTTP** — `POST /api/{query,store,search,manage}` direct — fallback when MCP/CLI unavailable.

Using a shared memory *well* takes discipline against drift — see [using ctx effectively](docs/using-ctx-effectively.md).

## Built with AI agents

ctx is built by AI agents working against a published RLHF-warnings calibration — a 22-axis map of LLM failure modes (memory drift, unattributed certainty, median-user caution) with concrete exemplars. It is the methodology reference behind this project's way of working: **[gottz.de/warnings.md](https://gottz.de/warnings.md)**. Background in [using ctx effectively](docs/using-ctx-effectively.md).

## Sponsoring

ctx runs its retrieval decisions on measurements, not vendor benchmarks: the ANN engine question (pgvector vs. pgvectorscale, VectorChord, pgContext, or a sovereign Go binary-quantization path) sits behind a trigger framework that only escalates on evidence from the project's own corpus. The current engine is measured at 100k vectors; validating the alternatives honestly means fanning out wide benchmark runs at 1M–10M vectors — index builds in the tens-of-GB range, hours of exact ground-truth computation per lane, dedicated hardware. Empirical benchmarks of alternative engines are gated on funding, not on curiosity.
