// CTX_CHAT_HOST therefore boots in perfect silence — the loader does not ignore
// the var with a complaint, it does not see it at all. design/06 §5.1 names that
// silent-ignore as the first break path of the cut, and a boot log is the only
// one of the project's three communication channels that reaches a CONCRETE
// deployment without anybody reading anything first (§6.1).
//
// Its predecessor read each key's wording from c.sources (live env var vs.
// shadowing settings row) and could only speak about keys the loader still knew;
// it died with its subject in β8. This one asks the environment directly, which
// is the X1 carve-out the design grants twice (§3.4, §3.5): the read feeds the

// stands. The emptiness test mirrors FromEnv byte for byte (load.go:296, empty
// env == unset) — a TrimSpace here would describe a different installation than
// the loader sees.
//
// Three filters, each of them the difference between a signal and noise:
//
//   - VALUE FILTER. A v4-era compose file materialises all 29 as `${VAR:-}`, so
//     every one of them is SET and empty on the whole compose cohort. An
//     existence scan would have printed up to 29 lines per boot there.
//   - VALUE-BEARING SUBSET (retiredEnvTripwireSuffixes).
//   - SCAFFOLD DEFAULTS (retiredEnvScaffoldDefaults).

// boot log travels into log aggregators and support bundles. The line carries
// the var NAME and the way out; the value stays where it is. retiredsources_test.go
// probes that negatively with a needle.
//
// The text does not say "remove it now" on purpose. Runbook order is: boot v5,
// verify the pool, THEN strip .env and the compose declarations (design/05 §9
// sentence 4, design/06 §3.3 steps 3+5) — the vars are the safety net of a

//     backend tuple and says nothing here: every name of this vintage carries

//   - OWN RELEASE (retiredV2Release) and own wording. There is no pool to
//     inspect and nothing to move the value to — the honest line says the key
//     is gone and the variable can go with it.
//   - OWN SCAFFOLD LIST, value-scoped like V1's.
//
// The VALUE FILTER stays byte for byte: empty env is unset for FromEnv
// (load.go), so a compose file that materialises the name as `${VAR:-}` must
// not produce a line here either. NAME-ONLY, like the whole sweep — the line

// the same reason: the loader is registry-driven, so a deployment that still
// exports one of these variables boots in perfect silence, and the boot log is
// the one channel that reaches a concrete deployment without anybody reading
// anything first.
//
// The REASON in the text is sharper than V2's. There the key had no successor
// because its value had stopped being read; here the SUBJECT is gone — the
// reader of the foreign agent state file and its distillsource adapter fell in
// v5.17.0, so the source these variables configured does not exist any more.
// That distinction is what keeps an operator from looking for a replacement
// key: there is no source left to point one at.
//
// NO SCAFFOLD LIST, and that is a measured absence rather than an omission.
// V1 and V2 each carry one because a name declared in the tracked compose file
// arrives set and NON-EMPTY on a whole cohort that never chose it. These three
// names never had such a declaration on any release: they entered the tracked
// compose file only with the `${NAME:-}` rewrite (T05-5, v5.16.0) and were
// absent from every file before it. So the value filter below already covers
// every untouched installation, and an exemption map would have no entry to
// hold — a name that arrives non-empty here is an operator's own line.

//
// The instruction it carries is SQL, not an API call. This binary IS the cut

// answers 404 in every scope — including for the tenant admins whose own
// api_key rows these are (design/06 §3.3 step 2a, §5.3). Migration 133 sweeps

// The precedent is the migration-132 embed-cache advisory
// (internal/events/coupled_fingerprint.go), which names its DELETE the same

//
// The embed-cache hint rode along on the coupled:embed-cache keys until β7,

// and costs nothing. Keeping the hint would have made this WARN quote a cost
