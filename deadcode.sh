# ctx — deadcode allowlist gate
# Usage: ./deadcode.sh [with-tests|testonly]
#
# Compares the reachability analysis of golang.org/x/tools/cmd/deadcode against
# an allowlist. Two failure directions, both blocking, in every mode:
#
#   * a symbol that is unreachable but NOT in the allowlist  -> cut it, or write
#     a line with a reason (the reason column is mandatory, so "keeping it" is a
#     visible decision in the diff rather than a matter of discipline);
#   * an allowlist line whose symbol became reachable again  -> delete the line.
#     Without this direction an allowlist only ever grows and turns into a lid.
#
# Two modes, two questions, two policy files:
#
#   with-tests (default)  deadcode -test  vs go/deadcode-allow.txt
#                         "is anything dead even when the tests are counted?"
#   testonly              deadcode        vs go/deadcode-testonly-allow.txt
#                         "which production symbols are alive ONLY because a
#                          test calls them?" (class T)
#
# The testonly run subtracts the with-tests allowlist from its own findings, so
# a symbol is never carried in both files: everything dead WITH the tests is by
# definition also dead without them, and that class already has its line and its
# reason in the first list. Subtracting the FILE (not a second deadcode run) is
# exact because the with-tests gate blocks in both directions — whenever it is
# green, its allowlist and its findings are the same set, and when it is red the
# push/CI stops at that gate anyway.
#
# deadcode is structurally blind to constants, vars, types and struct fields; it
# reports functions and methods only (measured in T02-13: a package-level var, a
# const and a type, each used solely by a _test.go, do not show up — the same
# file's func and method do). The `unused` linter in .golangci.yml does not close
# that gap for the test-only class either: it counts a use from a _test.go as a
# use and stays silent on exported identifiers. So class T is enforced here for
# functions and methods, and NOT enforced anywhere for vars, consts and types —
# a deliberate, documented limit rather than an assumed cover.
